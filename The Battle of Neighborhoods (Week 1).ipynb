Our focus will be in venues related to supermarkets, grocery shops or shopping malls in order to visualize the current presence of this kind of business in its area of the city. After that we will explore those neighborhoods with lack of supermarkets that are closer to the historical city center (Stare Mesto) instead of areas that belong to the suburbs of Bratislava and propose the optimal area for a new supermarket."
